A set of useful static methods to deal with date

Note that if Ext.Date is required and loaded, it will copy all methods / properties to
this object for convenience

The date parsing and formatting syntax contains a subset of
<a href="http://www.php.net/date">PHP's date() function</a>, and the formats that are
supported will provide results equivalent to their PHP versions.

The following is a list of all currently supported formats:

        1) If unspecified, the month / day defaults to the current month / day,   1991 or
           the time defaults to midnight, while the timezone defaults to the      1992-10 or
           browser's timezone. If a time is specified, it must include both hours 1993-09-20 or
           and minutes. The "T" delimiter, seconds, milliseconds and timezone     1994-08-19T16:20+01:00 or

        Refer to the examples on the right for the various levels of              1999-03-14T20:24:32Z or
        date-time granularity which are supported, or see                         2000-02-13T21:25:33

  U     Seconds since the Unix Epoch (January 1 1970 00:00:00 GMT)                1193432466 or -2138434463
  MS    Microsoft AJAX serialized dates                                           \/Date(1238606590509)\/ (i.e. UTC milliseconds since epoch) or
                                                                                  \/Date(1238606590509+0800)\/
</pre>

Example usage (note that you must escape format specifiers with '\\' to render them as character literals):

    // Sample date:
    // 'Wed Jan 10 2007 15:05:01 GMT-0600 (Central Standard Time)'
    
    var dt = new Date('1/10/2007 03:05:01 PM GMT-0600');
    console.log(Ext.Date.format(dt, 'Y-m-d'));                          // 2007-01-10
    console.log(Ext.Date.format(dt, 'F j, Y, g:i a'));                  // January 10, 2007, 3:05 pm
    console.log(Ext.Date.format(dt, 'l, \\t\\he jS \\of F Y h:i:s A')); // Wednesday, the 10th of January 2007 03:05:01 PM

Here are some standard date/time patterns that you might find helpful.  They
are not part of the source of Ext.Date, but to use them you can simply copy this
block of code into any script that is included after Ext.Date and they will also become
globally available on the Date object.  Feel free to add or remove patterns as needed in your code.

    Ext.Date.patterns = {
        ISO8601Long:"Y-m-d H:i:s",
        ISO8601Short:"Y-m-d",
        ShortDate: "n/j/Y",
        LongDate: "l, F d, Y",
        FullDateTime: "l, F d, Y g:i:s A",
        MonthDay: "F d",
        ShortTime: "g:i A",
        LongTime: "g:i:s A",
        SortableDateTime: "Y-m-d\\TH:i:s",
        UniversalSortableDateTime: "Y-m-d H:i:sO",
        YearMonth: "F, Y"
    };

Example usage:

    var dt = new Date();
    console.log(Ext.Date.format(dt, Ext.Date.patterns.ShortDate));

<p>Developer-written, custom formats may be used by supplying both a formatting and a parsing function
which perform to specialized requirements. The functions are stored in <a href="#!/api/Ext.Date-property-parseFunctions" rel="Ext.Date-property-parseFunctions" class="docClass">parseFunctions</a> and <a href="#!/api/Ext.Date-property-formatFunctions" rel="Ext.Date-property-formatFunctions" class="docClass">formatFunctions</a>.</p>
